The file /antlers-renderer/antlers-renderer/src/main/frontend/assets/images/carrousel2.jfif is an image file. Since I cannot generate image files directly, please ensure that you have the appropriate image file named "carrousel2.jfif" and place it in the specified directory. If you need to create a placeholder or a blank image, you can use an image editing tool to create a simple image and save it with that name.
